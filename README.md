# Working at Kaedim

Welcome!

If you are considering applying to Kaedim and want to learn more, you‚Äôre in the right place.

We are hiring for a lot of roles: https://wellfound.com/company/kaedim/jobs 

Priority: Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Customer Support Engineer

## What do we do

We are an AI startup building Machine Learning algorithms to turn images into digital 3D models. We have¬†the most accurate, game-ready 2d ‚Üí 3d asset generation pipeline by using our AI¬†and in-house art team. Currently, we are offering a¬†5-10x speed up to 3D asset creation pipelines of game developers, working with partners like¬†Netflix,¬†Voodoo, Upland,¬†Azra Games.

## Vision and mission

Kaedim‚Äôs vision is to accelerate the transition to a world powered by digital 3D content.

Our team is developing the next generation of tools for digital creators to accelerate their workflows and give them back time to be more creative.

## Why does this matter

- Digital 3D content is the future. Everything **slowly** turns to 3D with games being the pioneers, then product design and architecture have been using 3D modelling for decades, e-commerce and 3D printing followed and the list goes on. We are building the future. We want to change **slowly** into **rapidly**.
- At the same time, the production of 3D content is one of the most expensive things for a business. It is really time-consuming, very manual and with software that is expensive and with very steep learning curves. We are going to solve this problem.
- Fundamentals: 3D content creation is unscalable and current processes are very old with huge space for optimisation. Using AI to solve this problem propels us even further.
- Gaming is bigger than all the other entertainment sectors combined and growing at a staggering pace.
- In short, we are empowering creators to focus on what matters most, do more with less, save time to invest in quality. We will be a unicorn helping everyone from indie game devs, to XBOX and Amazon realise this new potential. That is impact!

## Results so far

- 200+ businesses onboard (game devs, product designers, 3D printing companies, etc)
- Net profitable within 12 months of our original launch
- Leaders of the field with the only product that generates ‚Äúready-to-use‚Äù 3D models
- Many failures and many lessons üí™

## Locations

- San Francisco, US
- London, UK

Everyone comes to the office 5+ days a week. If you prefer working in a remote or hybrid setting, we would not recommend applying.

## Who we are looking for

- Engineering only. Minimum 2 years of experience writing professional production-level code in your respective stack. If you are still at uni or a recent graduate personal projects that are impressive count too. Equivalent for design.
- Strong culture fit (see below). High energy, true owner, cares deeply, goes above and beyond.
- Big plus: Familiarity with Blender or other 3D modelling software.
- High interest/passion for the intersection of art and technology
- You do not need to be a gamer.

## Culture

At Kaedim, every team member is:

- Hardworking
- Ambitious
- Resilient
- Proactive
- Humble
- Autonomous and accountable

In summary, we hire for passion, work ethic, discipline and autonomy. We believe that everything else can be learned.

We value speed of execution over perfection. Products are never perfect when they are first released. We iterate daily to reach there.

You will not be micromanaged. You will have tons of freedom, and you will own your work. Extreme ownership and accountability.

If you are passionate about empowering creators, working in the intersection of art and technology, working with driven people with a high amount of autonomy, and seeing the results of your work quickly go to production - this might be a good fit for you.

**If you join us, you‚Äôll be one of the first 10 engineering hires. This means:**

1. You‚Äôll help make our product a world-class service for content creators and designers.
2. You‚Äôll help shape the product into a staple for the content creation pipelines.
3. You‚Äôll help set world-class engineering practices.
4. You‚Äôll help build a world-class team.
5. You‚Äôll have a direct impact on the direction and progress of our product from DAY 1 (everyone pushes to production daily).

**What is work/life balance like at your company?**

Kaedim is our number one priority and we all make significant sacrifices daily. We are in this to make it huge and do the best work of our lives. 

People usually leave work late at night. As a result of being an early-stage startup, we wouldn‚Äôt want to hide this reality from prospective candidates: raw hours make a big difference in the impact we can make right now. So, the team works through most evenings and on some weekends, but it‚Äôs driven by personal ambition. No one tells you how many hours to work, but the team has rocketship speed.

**Are you open to bringing on interns for any of your roles?**

Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have the bandwidth necessary to offer a great internship program. We must invest every ounce of energy into making a great product first. 

Having said that, we‚Äôve had engineers working part-time with us during their studies who joined full-time after graduation (or dropped out). If you are still at university but have really high autonomy/speed and an appetite for large amounts of responsibility, we are encouraging you to apply. Disclaimer: there will be little to no mentorship, you‚Äôll have to find your own way around things that you don‚Äôt know how to do.

## Compensation

- Market average base
- Substantial equity - you‚Äôll be part of the founding team

## Visa sponsorship

Available for the US and UK for recent graduates and candidates who are already based in the US/UK. We will do our best to support you.

## Recruiting process

1. Screen.
2. Online coding test (only for engineering) OR take home (for non-engineering).
3. Live coding on Google Meet with team members from the team you are applying to join (SWE/MLE).
4. Interview with CEO.
5. A day in the office spent working with us on a challenge. At the end of the day, you‚Äôll present your solution and thought process to the whole team and get to know the rest of the team members from other departments.
6. Offer or feedback within 48 hours.

We will move quickly and will do our best not to waste your time
